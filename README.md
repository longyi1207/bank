# App Introduction
This is an app simulating a bank system, in which you have unique credentials, and you can create, delete, and perform any operations on one or many accounts associated with your user credential.
Specifically, you can either create checking or saving accounts. Checking accounts have a 50% per minute interest rate; saving accounts have a 100% per minute interest rate, yet they are associated with certain constraints that are free on checking accounts.
You can perform six operations on any account: check account uuid, delete account, deposit money, withdraw money, transfer money, and review transaction history.
